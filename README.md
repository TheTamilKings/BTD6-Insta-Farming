# BTD6-Insta-Farming
Macros for farming insta monkeys. 

The macros are intended for use with the current version of AutoHotkey (install at autohotkey.com if you don't already have it). Your monitor and in game resolutions will need to be set at 1920 X 1080 (fullscreen) in order for the placements to be correct.
Once completed this repository should contain four different macros used for farming insta monkeys. You can use any combination of the macros based on your needs. During collection events I would recommend using the macro for Infernal due to it having the highest collection rewards, but once again use whatever macro(s) seem the most appealing to you.

The four macros are Cubism, Downstream, Off the Coast, and Infernal (all of which take place on impoppable dificulty).
Use Cubism for tier 0 to 2 instas, use Downstream for tier 1 to 3 instas, use Off the Coast for tier 2 to 4 instas, use Infernal for tier 3 and 4 instas (and probably collection events).

Two very important things:
1) While I personally do not believe that your account will get flagged or banned for using these macros, Ninja Kiwi has stated that they do not support the use of macros in the game, so please utilize these macros at your own risk.
2) I have seen other macros that can potentially result in the macro continuing your game over and over again after dying and thus wasting all of your monkey money. I tried to design these macros with as little RNG as possible, and in all of the runs I have done on them I have never once game overed. That being said, do be weary that if for some reason you were to lose, these macros could spend some or all of your monkey money. Once again, please utilize these macros at your own risk.

If you have any questions or concerns about the macros, please leave a comment and I will try and help you to the best of my ability. 
Overall, I hope these macros are able to improve your insta farming experience, good luck on your black borders!
